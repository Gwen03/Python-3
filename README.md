I'm trying to make a text based open world concept game, so as few options and non linear as possible.

Mainly trying to use preset keywords that most likely will be used by players to guess what they want to do, and perform relevant action. I'm currently stuck here.

I figured out how to get the thing above, added an inventory and made helpme a keyword as well.

I learnt how to use functions in line 23 for inventory so that I can find it easier in future. I should organise it more, I wonder how other coders do it. Do they made another bot to keep track or just a text file? I shall make a text file before this gets out of hand..

My inventory does not know how to keep track properly though, gonna have to figure that out. I fixed it, order of stuff were just wrong. Call order is important

Maybe add some mini linear storylines or quests for the player to solve for small rewards?

I added coordinates so players can find monsters. I called another python script for each monster cos i think its gonna get too long and cluttered put tgt. And the monsters can be very repetative in terms of code right

I need more insperation for linear storylines

Maybe even have a big boss to fight? That tells the player they beat the game, but they can go back and play more if they want, kinda like minecraft ender dragon kinda deal.

Man this whole thing sounds kinda like a bad minecraft spin off
